\section{\textbf{Introduction}}
\vspace{1mm}

\small{
I am a PhD Student in Electrical Engineering, studying computer architecture and VLSI under Professor Ramesh Karri at New York University. I'm interested in developing energy efficient AI accelerators using approximate, analogue, and asynchronous architectures, and models and infrastructure for energy vs. accuracy tradeoffs in those architectures. My life goal is to produce research, scientists, and engineers that will bring this future paradigm to life as a tenured professor at an R1 university.
